Performance Optimization Tools

1. Prevent wasted renders (A render that didn't produce any change in the DOM)
useMemo
useCallback
passing elements as chidlren or regular prop

2. Improve App Speed / Responsiveness
useMemo
useCallback
useTransition

3. Reduce Bundle size
fewer 3rd-party packages
code splitting and lazy loading

Memoization
Memoize components with memo
Memoize objects with useMemo
Memoize functions with useCallback

To see the usecase of memo function, see the original App.js of atomic blog (Before the context was used)

Bundling and Code Splitting
Bundle - Code is stored on web server, whenever user wants to see website, the server will send a huge js file which will have all application code
This is the js bundle that is required on the client side to see the application

Bundle size - the size of the js code

Code splitting - The entire app bundle is splitted into parts that can be downloaded over time. So the user doesn't need the entire app code to see the webpage
this process is known as lazy loading
usually the code is splitted at the page level see the app.js file for this implementation
